	No substantive changes needed.

2010-05-19  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* test/unit/test-settracefunc.rb, test/unit/test-trace.rb,
	threadframe-ruby-1.9.patch: Add event masks for
	Thread#set_trace_func and Thread#add_trace_func.  tf.trace_off now
	works at least some times.  Remove bugs introduced prior in trying
	to work around trace_off.  By the way, .... event
	Kernel#set_trace_func and add_trace_func are broken for handling
	event masks. Never noticed this before. Will deal with later I hope.

	2010) is not compatible.  We will track that down subsequently...

	sure!

2009-12-13  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* README.rdoc, threadframe.rdoc: This time, for sure?

2009-12-13  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* threadframe.rd, threadframe.rdoc: I think github will recognizes
	.rdoc as an RDoc extension, not .rb.

2009-11-05  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* threadframe-ruby-1.9.patch: Remove Ruby 1.9 SEGV that can occur in
	instruction tracing a "leave" instruction.  I don't understand why
	we get this, calling the trace where we do in a "leave" instruction
	may somehow mess up cfp-> iseq such as via vm.c line 1144:   ep = ... cfp->iseq ...  Since we can handle this event via RUBY_EVENT_END I don't think
	there is any loss in functionality.

2009-11-04  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/iseq_extra.c, test/unit/test-iseq-brkpt.rb: DRY breakpoint

	* ext/iseq_extra.c, ext/iseq_mini.h, threadframe-ruby-1.9.patch: 
	Remove flakiness in killcache. VALUE is not int (on 64-bit
	machines).  Expose from Ruby instruction name and opcode length so
	we can do better about knowing when "getinlinecache" is that --
	without copying generated headers.

2009-11-01  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ChangeLog, Rakefile, ext/iseq_extra.c: Add rake test for
	ChangeLog.

2009-10-24  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/iseq_extra.c, ext/proc_extra.c, test/unit/test-iseq-brkpt.rb: 
	RubyVM::InstructionSequence#brktps - an Array of offsets that
	breakpoints have been set or nil if no breakpoints allocated.

2009-10-24  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/thread_frame.c, test/unit/test-thread.rb: Add access to dfp.
	And while we are at it, RDOC these, complete with workarounds to

2009-10-17  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	iseq_extra.rb: add offset2line() analogue - line2offsets()

2009-10-16  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* lib/iseq_extra.rb, test/unit/test-lib-iseq-extra.rb: 
	iseq_extra.rb: add lineoffsets to get the offset for a given line

2009-09-29  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/iseq_extra.c, ext/proc_extra.c, ext/thread_frame.c: Bang on

	ext/thread_frame.c, test/unit/test-source.rb: Add
	RubyVM::InstructionSequence#source_container and Method#iseq.  Code
	for source_container is mostly moved from RubyVM::ThreadFrame so
	that now calls the iseq code for instruction sequences.  Move/add source_container from thread_frame into iseq.

2009-09-26  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/iseq_extra.c, test/unit/test-iseq.rb: offset2lines ->
	offsetlines (returns a hash) offset2lines now takes a parameter that
	returns *only* the lines for that offset.  (Good thing no one other
	than myself uses this.)

2009-09-24  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/iseq_extra.c, ext/iseq_extra.h, test/unit/test-iseq.rb,
	test/unit/test-thread.rb: Add ability to get line numbers for
	instruction offset. (Florian: I'm still weeping.)

2009-09-17  rockyb <rocky@gnu.org>

	* ext/thread_frame.c, test/unit/test-thread.rb: More defensive of
	CFRAMES. Also have to back off some tests until I figure out what's
	up with the C method disappearance.

2009-09-15  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* ext/thread_frame.c, test/unit/test-thread.rb: For now I need to be
	more aggressive about checking for (exec) as a file name.
	Apparently the string (exec) can propagate backwards into enclosing
	blocks.

2009-09-14  R. Bernstein <rocky@gnu.org>

	* test/unit/cfunc-use.rb, test/unit/test-thread.rb: Add unit test
	for source_container of a CFUNC.

2009-09-14  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/thread_frame.c: If C Frame, use location of previous on stack.

	* ext/ruby19_externs.h, ext/thread_frame.c, test/unit/test-prev.rb: 
	Negative offset in prev counts from the other direction. Add more
	stringent argument type checking in prev routines.

2009-08-02  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/method_mini.h, ext/thread_frame.c, test/unit/test-thread.rb,
	threadframe.rd: Remove ThreadFrame#method_class. Programs should use

	orig, klass.

2009-07-29  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/.gitignore, ext/extconf.rb: Finally figured out how to
	customize the mkmf Makefile WITHOUT checking in those options into
	version control

2009-07-28  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/thread_frame.c: Small prev bugs.

2009-07-28  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/thread_frame.c, test/unit/test-thread.rb: Add optional count

	ext/thread_frame.c, ext/vm_core_mini.h: Track changes in C
	structures for control frame and instruction sequence.  Add
	structurs from method.h.  Be more explicit about what externs came
	from where and which are patched.  frame method_class no longer
	makes sense.

2009-07-25  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/iseq_extra.c, ext/thread_frame.c, test/unit/test-iseq.rb: 
	iseq_extra.c: iseq_local_name() check for negative indexes.  correct
	rdoc. More tests.

2009-07-24  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/iseq_extra.c, lib/.gitignore, test/unit/test-thread.rb: Was
	SEGV'ing in arity on C-style frames.

2009-07-24  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* lib/.gitignore, lib/iseq_extra.rb: Was SEGV'ing in arity on
	C-style frames.

2009-07-24  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/iseq_extra.h, ext/proc_extra.c, ext/proc_extra.h,
	ext/thread_frame.c: Tidy proc_extra/thread_frame interaction.
	Probably we need to create a driver e.g. "introspection" which
	combines thread_frame, proc, and iseq.

2009-07-23  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/iseq_extra.c, ext/iseq_extra.h, ext/thread_frame.c,

	test/unit/test-invalid.rb, test/unit/test-iseq.rb,
	test/unit/test-proc.rb, test/unit/test-thread.rb: Allow access to
	iseq parameter counts and integer values and local table names..
	Clean up access to iseq methods. Still need to do proc_extra.{c,h}
	like this.

2009-07-23  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/iseq_extra.c, ext/iseq_extra.h, ext/proc_extra.h,
	ext/ruby19_externs.h, ext/thread_frame.c, test/unit/test-thread.rb,
	th.rb: Add iseq#arity and ThreadFrame#arity

2009-07-23  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	lambda. Add Proc and lambda tests.

2009-07-22  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	ThreadFrame#type is the MAGIC string now.

2009-07-22  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/thread_frame.c, test/unit/test-thread.rb: prev skips over
	FINISH frames. Extract VM_FRAME_MAGIC translation code from
	vm_dump.c

2009-07-22  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/thread_frame.c, test/unit/test-thread.rb: Add all frame types.

2009-07-20  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/thread_frame.c, test/unit/test-invalid.rb,
	test/unit/test-thread.rb: Lame attempt at handling C frames. An
	additional "unknown" frame seems to be slipping in. Need to
	investigate and fix in a less flaky way.

2009-07-20  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/thread_frame.c: Add ThreadFrame#type to indicate what kind of
	frame we got. Todo: fix ThreadFrame#prev not to skip over C frames
	and do a fixup of those.

2009-07-20  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* test/unit/test-thread.rb: One more small test

2009-07-20  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/thread_frame.c, ext/thread_pthread.h, ext/vm_core_mini.h,
	test/unit/test-thread.rb: Presumably this copes with C frames
	better. Better unit tests are needed.

2009-07-20  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/thread_frame.c: More DRY through the magic of macros.

2009-07-20  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/thread_frame.c: Squeeze out a little more DRYness.

2009-07-20  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/thread_frame.c: DRY code more.

2009-07-19  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	* ext/thread_frame.c: DRY code a little.

2009-07-19  rocky <rockyb@rubyforge.org>

	Threadframe#method - returns associated method name.

2009-07-16  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* ext/thread_frame.c: Sort of along the idea for adding pc_offset=

2009-07-15  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* README: Typo

2009-07-13  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* .gitignore, Rakefile: Correct gem creation. This time, for sure!

2009-07-12  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* ext/proc_extra.c, ext/thread_extra.h, ext/thread_frame.c,
	ext/vm_core_mini.h, test/unit/test-thread.rb: Add ability to get pc
	offset into instruction sequence.  Merge rest of thread_extra.h into
	vm_core_mini.h.  Everything in vm_core_mini.h is really a subset of
	Ruby 1.9's vm_core.h.

2009-07-12  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* Rakefile: Add code to build a gem.

2009-07-12  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* ext/thread_frame.c, ext/vm_core_mini.h,
	test/unit/test-invalid.rb, threadframe.rd: Add ThreadFrame#invalid?
	ThreadFrame#binding now checks validity of frame before making a
	binding.

2009-07-10  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* test/unit/test-invalid.rb: Add first cut at ThreadFrame#invalid?

2009-07-10  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	bp. Move more vm_core.h things into vm_core_mini.h

2009-07-09  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* ext/proc_extra.c, ext/vm_core_mini.h, test/unit/test-proc.rb: Add
	minimal Proc.new().iseq test

2009-07-06  rocky <rocky@gnu.org>

	* ext/proc_extra.c, ext/ruby19_externs.h, ext/thread_extra.c,
	ext/thread_frame.c, ext/vm_core_mini.h: Add iseq method to Proc.

2009-07-05  rocky <rocky@sanchez.(none)>

	* ext/ruby19_externs.h, ext/thread_extra.h, ext/thread_frame.c,
	ext/vm_core_mini.h, test/unit/test-thread.rb, th.rb, threadframe.rd: 
	Add tf.source_container. Make source_location an array to follow the
	threadframe.rd API. Move Ruby externs into a separate file. Need now
	to include part of iseq definition in order to pick out filename.

2009-07-02  rocky <rocky@sanchez.(none)>

	* ext/thread_frame.c, th.rb, threadframe.rd: First stab at
	tf.source_location. More to come later...

	* ext/thread_frame.c, test/unit/test-binding.rb,
	test/unit/test-thread.rb, th.rb, threadframe.rd: Thread::Frame ->

2009-06-28  rocky <rocky@sanchez.(none)>

	* ext/thread_extra.h, ext/thread_frame.c: Add Thread#stack to see
	what it gives (which seems to be nil). Will probably remove later.

2009-06-28  rocky <rocky@sanchez.(none)>

	* ext/thread_extra.h, ext/thread_frame.c, ext/vm_core_mini.h,
	test/unit/test-binding.rb, test/unit/test-thread.rb, th.rb: 
	Workaround bug in Thread::Frame#prev where frame is an inline C
	type. For now we can only deal with Ruby frames.  Reinstate
	Thread::Frame::current, since that's so common.

2009-06-26  rocky <rocky@sanchez.(none)>

	* ext/thread_frame.c, test/unit/test-binding.rb,
	test/unit/test-thread.rb: A little closer to API ... add
	Thread:threadframe which is in API and remove Thread::Frame::current
	which wasn't.  Is probably more correct in terms of code as well. (And probably
	more bugs remain).

2009-06-25  rocky <rocky@sanchez.(none)>

	* Rakefile, ext/thread_frame.c: See above.

2009-06-25  rocky <rocky@sanchez.(none)>

	tests. Fix erroneous unit test.

2009-06-24  rocky <rocky@sanchez.(none)>

	* test/test-thread.rb: Thread::Frame#new() now takes a Thread object
	and returns a fully-initialized object now.  Add
	Thread::Frame#thread.

2009-06-24  rocky <rocky@sanchez.(none)>

	* ext/thread_frame.c, test/test-binding.rb, th.rb: ThreadFrame ->
	Thread::Frame

2009-06-23  rocky <rocky@sanchez.(none)>

	* threadframe.rd: Start my thankyous early and often

2009-06-23  rocky <rocky@sanchez.(none)>

	* threadframe.rd: ThreadFrame -> Thread::Frame. Thread::Frame::new
	defined as Thread#threadframe. Added Thread::Frame#binding and
	Thread:Frame#source_container

2009-06-14  rocky <rocky@sanchez.(none)>

	* threadframe.rd: Modifications based on qwik.atdot.net discussion.

2009-06-14  rocky <rocky@sanchez.(none)>

	* ext/thread_extra.c, ext/thread_extra.h, ext/thread_frame.c,
	test/test-binding.rb: Add ThreadFrame.prev1()

2009-04-09  rocky <rocky@sanchez.(none)>

	* ext/thread_frame.c: Save thread pointer along with the
	control-frame pointer in a ThreadFrame

2009-04-05  rocky <rocky@sanchez.(none)>

	* Initial cut at extracting a thread frame
