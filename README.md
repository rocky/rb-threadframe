# rb-threadframe

rb-threadframe is a set of patches to Ruby MRI 1.9.2 and a C extension
that gives introspection access for method call frames.

Some patches have been started for MRI 1.9.3 but this is far from complete.

## Requirements

Source for Ruby MRI version 1.9.2 or 1.9.3 p141. Patches are provided
for these two versions only.

See the [wiki](http://github.com/rocky/rb-threadframe/wiki) for more information.
